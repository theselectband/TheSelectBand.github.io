  <h3>The words to our songs!</h3>
      <br>
    <h1>Defective Demonstration</h1>
    <h3>Punkinator</h3>
<p>Don't act a fool<br> 
Punkinator's gonna make you cool<br>
Don't try to fight<br>
You'll be a punk tonight<br>
First goes your style<br>
It does not take a while<br>
When you're punk rock<br>
You've got to have a mohawk<br>
<br>
Punkinator<br>
Robot dictator<br>
Punkinator<br>
Punk generator<br>
<br>
Looking all over town<br>
Punkinator's gonna hunt you down<br>
In the moonlight<br>
Punkinator stands shining bright<br>
Don't try to run<br>
Punkinator can't be outdone<br>
Get too close and you'll find out<br>
What being punk is all about<br>
<br></p>
<h3>No Difference</h3>
<p>It makes no difference what you say<br>
I’ve made my mind up anyway go!<br>
<br>
It makes no difference what you say<br>
It makes no difference what you say<br>
It makes no difference what you say<br>
I’ve made my mind up anyway<br>
<br></p>
<h3>My Own Head</h3>
<p>There are days where I can't get out of bed<br>
Days where I can't get out of my own head<br>
These days everything just feels the same<br>
I can't figure out if I'm the one to blame<br>
<br>
I feel like my whole mind is falling apart<br>
Nothing can save me can't get me to start<br>
Sometimes I feel like my life is in a great descend<br>
Sometimes I feel like this is the end<br>
<br>
I know it can't go on like this what am I to do<br>
I don't know how I could ever possibly get through<br>
I think I'm doing too much but it never feels enough<br>
What am I supposed to do when life gets so tough<br>
<br></p>
<h3>Everything</h3>
<p>Sometimes at night, I dream about you<br>
Big surprise I know, but just see this through<br>
All of our dreams, are coming true<br>
We're gonna do it all I know you want it too<br>
<br>
What more can I say it'll all be okay<br>
One of these days the skies won't be so gray<br>
We'll be having the time of our lives<br>
And in the end everything will be just fine<br>
<br>
You're standing there looking at me<br>
I wish it could be our reality<br>
I know it's not always a guarantee<br>
But someday soon we are going to be free<br>
<br></p>
<h3>Is This It?</h3>
<p>Stranded the middle of the ocean<br>
From time to time my mind's full of confusion<br>
I am filled to the brim with emotion<br>
Sometimes I feel like there's no solution<br>
<br>
I want to float above the water not being held down<br>
I'm always found at the surface where I can almost breathe<br>
But a dark void that the water pulls me to is beneath<br>
Am I too far gone to save? For one good gasp of air<br>
<br>
So far from the beginning to close to the end<br>
Slowly getting closer to suffocating<br>
Really starts to feel like I am drowning<br>
the bottom is near and it's so aggravating<br>
<br>
Stranded in the middle of the ocean<br>
I can start to feel myself slowly floating<br>
I've been waiting so long for this kind of motion<br>
Finally the warmth of the light is beaming<br>
<br></p>
